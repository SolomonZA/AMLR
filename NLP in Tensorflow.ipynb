    "Tensorflow is an open-source library widely used for machine learning. It is second only to the Python machine learning library Scikit-learn in terms of use and popularity. Similar to Keras, it allows a user to implement a powerful deep learning model in relatively few lines of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Many sophisticated applications today make use of Tensorflow-based machine learning to exploit the wealth of data at their disposal. This includes voice recognition, machine translation and sentimement analysis, image recognition, video detection and recommender systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we'll implement a simple Recurrent Neural Network which makes use of a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) which enables RNNs to have longer term memory, giving them similar performance as LSTMs and sometimes better on small datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is a character-level RNN which aims to predict the next character in a sequence, based on a prior sequence.\n"
