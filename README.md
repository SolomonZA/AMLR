# AMLR
Applied Machine Learning Research
---

This is a repo for developing and applying machine learning models.

The models are primarily neural networks.

The domain of these models are natural language processing tasks, such as next-character prediction.

In addition, some work on machine learning interpretability will also be included in this repo.
