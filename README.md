# AMLR
Applied Machine Learning Research
---

This is a repo for developing and applying machine learning models.

The models are primarily neural networks.

The domain of these models are natural language processing tasks, such as next-character prediction.

In addition, some work on machine learning interpretability will also be included in this repo.

# Pure Python (NumPy) Recurrent Neural Network
---

The Pure Python (NumPy) Recurrent Neural Network (from now on Pure RNN) is a "fully recurrent" RNN.

The [image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network "RNN - Wikipedia") graphically depicts the process.
